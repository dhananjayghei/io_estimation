\section{Introduction}
What is the fixed cost of exporting a movie to a foreign country? This
paper tries to answer this question using a moment inequality approach
by estimating the bounds on the fixed costs. In particular, we use a
revealed preference approach as in \citep{pakes2015}. We use the data
on exports of movies from 5 different countries (France, Germany,
Spain, UK and US) to each other between 2001-2009.  Exporting
decisions of a firm depends on the expected profit it will earn when
serving a foreign market. Such estimates are rarely observed in the
data. Thus, while the firm observes the fixed cost of exporting, the
econometrician does not. Moment inequality approach relies on the
information set available to the firms which are making the exporting
decisions to put a bound on these estimates.

The estimation methodology in the paper is closely related to a
growing body of literature in the field of moment inequalities. Some
of these papers include \citet{chernozhukov2013}, \citet{manski2004},
\citet{pakes2010}, \citet{andrews2010}, \citet{holmes2011},
\citet{ho2009}. One benefit of using this approach is that we need not
require the econometrician to have full knowledge of the exporter's
information set. The econometrician can rely on certain key variables
from the information set and yet derive consistent estimates (or,
bounds) based on this smaller information set. Therefore, in this case
the estimates are only partially identified instead of being point
identified. This gives us a more reasonable range of numbers which can
be shown to be consistent in large samples.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we
describe the model that is used for constructing the decisions to
export. Section 3 describes the data, some issues at hand while
cleaning the data and the summary statistics on the data. Section 4
lays out the construction for moment inequalities and estimation
procedure for the same. Section 5 discusses the results and Section 6
concludes.
\section{Model}
We follow closely to \citep{dickstein2018} in the model's
notation. Consider a movies' export decision. All movies' of country
$h$ choose whether to export in each of the export markets $j$. In our
case, $h,j=1,2,3,4,5$ where the numbers denote the following
countries, namely - France(1), Germany(2), Spain(3), UK(4), US(5).\\
The firms' decide whether to export the movie to any of the $j$
countries or not. If it decides to export, it pays a fixed exporting
cost. \\
We model the export profits that movie $i$ from country $h$ would
obtain in country $j$ at time $t$ as:
\begin{align*}
  \pi_{ijt} = \eta^{-1}r_{ijt} - f_{ijt}
\end{align*}
where, $\eta$ is the demand elasticity assumed to be constant across
markets, $r_{ijt}$ is the revenue that the movie $i$ earns in country
$j$ at time $t$ and $f_{ijt}$ is the fixed cost of exporting the movie
$i$ to country $j$ in time $t$. \\
We model the fixed export cost in three different ways - firstly, the
fixed costs are assumed to be destination/origin/time invariant;
secondly, the fixed costs are assumed to be destination-country
specific; and thirdly, the fixed costs are allowed to be
destination-origin country specific. These cases are shown below:
\begin{align*}
  f_{ijt} = \begin{cases}
    \beta_0 + \nu_{ijt}\\
    \beta_{0j} + \nu_{ijt}\\
    \beta_{0ij} + \nu_{ijt}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where, $\nu_{ijt}$ is the residual term that the econometrician does
not observe. We assume that the firms know the fixed costs $f_{ijt}$.
We will assume that the error term in the fixed cost $\nu_{ijt}$
follows a normal distribution and is independent of export
determinants i.e.
\begin{align*}
  \nu_{ijt} \perp \mathcal{I}_{ijt} \qquad \nu_{ijt} \sim N(0, \sigma_v^2)
\end{align*}
where, $\mathcal{I}_{ijt}$ is the information set of firm $i$ on
country $j$ at time $t$.\\
The risk-neutral firm $i$ will decide to export to country $j$ in
period $t$ if the expected profit is greater than or equal to zero
i.e. $\mathbb{E}[\pi_{ijt} | \mathcal{I}_{ijt}, \nu_{ijt}] \geq 0$.
The information set $\mathcal{I}_{ijt}$ contains the variables that a
movie $i$ uses to predict the revenue in the country $j$ at time
$t$. These variables could include predicted revenue, prices, etc.\\
The expected profits can be written more explicitly as:
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[\pi_{ijt}|\mathcal{I}_{ijt}, \nu_{ijt}] = \eta^{-1}
  \mathbb{E}[r_{ijt} | \mathcal{I}_{ijt}, \nu_{ijt}] - \beta_0 - \nu_{ijt}
\end{align*}
Let
$d_{ijt} = \mathbbm{1}\{\eta^{-1}\mathbb{E}[r_{ijt} |
\mathcal{I}_{ijt}, \nu_{ijt}] - \beta_0 - \nu_{ijt} \geq 0\}$
denote the decision of movie $i$ to export to country $j$ at time $t$
where, $\mathbbm{1}$ denotes the indicator function.
\section{Data}
We have data on movies from 5 different countries - France, Germany,
Spain, UK and US from 2001-2009. There are a total of 5500
observations over the 8 years. The data set contains observations on
the actual revenue in the country where the movie was released and the
predicted revenue if the movie was not exported to the country. We
also have a data set on the average box office ticket price in the 5
countries.
\subsection{Data cleaning}
There are certain discrepancies in the data set which one needs to
take care of before proceeding to estimation. For example, consider
the movie ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' which is a movie
from UK but has missing value of actual revenues in the UK. This is
because the movie was released in the UK under the name ``Harry Potter
and the Philosopher's Stone'' and therefore, these values are
missing. In particular, we have 643 observations of this sort. We drop
these observations from our analysis as this will bias our
estimates. Thus, we have a total of 4857 observations after
dropping these observations. \\
In addition, there are some other movie titles which are
duplicated. Consider for example, ``Berlin Is in Germany'' which is
labelled both as a German and French movie. There are 19 such
duplicates. This is particularly because the movies were jointly
produced in the two countries. However, estimating the fixed costs
using such observations will lead to double counting in the first two
cases and therefore, we need to drop these observations for the
initial analysis.

\section{Methodology}
I use the revealed preference moment inequalities for estimation of
the lower and upper bounds. The literature used either odds-based or
moments-based inequalities or a combination of both to estimate the
bounds. However, I will do the revealed preferences approach as done
in \citep{pakes2015} as this was the one we were expected to follow in
this paper. For any $\mathcal{Z}_{ijt} \subsetneq \mathcal{I}_{ijt}$,
we define a conditional revealed preference moment inequality as:
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{Z}_{ijt}, \theta) = \mathbb{E}\bigg[ m(d_{ijt},
  r_{ijt}; \theta) \bigg| \mathcal{Z}_{ijt} \bigg] \geq 0
\end{align*}
where, $\theta$ is the list of parameters to be estimated
$\theta = \{\beta_0, \sigma_{v}\}$ and the moment function $m$ is a
$2 \times 1$ vector of moment conditions defined as:
\begin{align*}
  m_l(.) = -(1-d_{ijt})(\eta^{-1}r_{ijt} - \beta_0) + d_{ijt} \sigma
  \frac{\phi(\sigma^{-1}(\eta^{-1}r_{ijt} -
  \beta_0))}{\Phi(\sigma^{-1}(\eta^{-1}r_{ijt} -\beta_0))}\\
  m_u(.) = d_{ijt})(\eta^{-1}r_{ijt} - \beta_0) + (1-d_{ijt}) \sigma
  \frac{\phi(\sigma^{-1}(\eta^{-1}r_{ijt} -
  \beta_0))}{1-\Phi(\sigma^{-1}(\eta^{-1}r_{ijt} -\beta_0))}
\end{align*}
Note the negative sign in front of the lower bound inequality
($m_l(.)$) which is written in a way that it converts it into an
inequality to be greater than or equal to zero. As we are only
interested in estimating the fixed costs, we calibrate the two
parameter values $\eta$ and $\sigma$ to be equal to 1 and 1
respectively. Following this, we solve the revealed preference
inequalities to estimate the parameter vector $\theta = \beta_0$
consistently. The consistency of the estimate is proven in
\citet{dickstein2018} for any instrument
$\mathcal{Z}_{ijt} \subsetneq \mathcal{I}_{ijt}$ for all $i,j$ and
$t$.\\
Using these moment inequalities, we estimate the bounds using three
sets of instruments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The expected revenue share (if the movie was released in the
  country) $(\mathcal{Z}_{ijt} = \{\hat s_{ijt}\})$
\item The expected revenue share and the lagged box office ticket
  price in the country
  $(\mathcal{Z}_{ijt} = \{ \hat s_{ijt}, p_{jt-1}\})$
\item The expected revenue share, the lagged box office ticket price
  and the lagged average revenue of the exporting country in the other
  country
  $(\mathcal{Z}_{ijt} = \{\hat s_{ijt}, p_{jt-1}, \bar s_{ijt-1}\})$
\end{enumerate}
We estimate the bounds for the three cases as above.
